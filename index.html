  			Hello and welcome to my website! I am a Political Science Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University, and my research interests include authoritarian governments, international law, human rights, and the laws of war. Before Stanford, I studied political science at UC San Diego.
  			<br><br>
  			As is probably apparent, I enjoy Californian weather, though I spend most of my free time in places with less comfortable climate. I recently traveled to Myanmar, the hometown of my parents. Myanmarâ€™s military regime is still deeply present in all aspects of civilian life, but the impact of democratization and economic liberalization can also be seen. Partially inspired by the events in Myanmar and other global happenings, I hope to tackle the question of why military regimes form and end in my current collaborative research.
  			<br><br>
  			For my second-year field paper, I am investigating patterns of human rights abuses across different types of authoritarian regimes. In particular, I am interested in how the fragmentation of elite authority affects the strategies of abuse autocratic leaders use to repress their populations.
  			<br><br>
  			Now, I am a rising third-year at Stanford and am preparing (or floundering?) to propose a project for my dissertation. I hope to say more on this by the next time you visit! Please stay tuned.
